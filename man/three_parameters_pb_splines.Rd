\title{three_parameters_pb_splines}
\usage{
three_parameters_pb_splines(model, ..., data, criterion, family)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A formula that defines the model for continuous norming.}

\item{data}{Defines the data set.}

\item{criterion}{Either "BIC", "AIC" or "GAIC(3)".}

\item{family}{A character that defines the specific PDF for modelling.}
}
\value{
The gamlss model selected by the free order procedure.
}
\description{
This function is in inner function and conducts the free order procedure
with penalized splines for PDFs with three parameters.
}
\details{
This function is used for penalized splines
}
\examples{
# Apply the free order procedure for a BCPE and the BIC.

                           data = Data_norm,
                           criterion = "BIC",
                           family = "BCPE")
